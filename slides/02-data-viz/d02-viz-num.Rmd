## 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- EDA is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize its main characteristics.

- Often, this is visual (graphs, tables). 

- But we also calculate numerical summaries at this stage.

### Why visualize? 

The following 13 datasets (from the `datasauRus` package) each have two variables $x$ and $y$ which are summarized below.


```{r summary-statistics,echo=F,message=F}

datasaurus_dozen %>%
  group_by(dataset) %>%
  summarize(meanx=mean(x),meany=mean(y),
            sdx=sd(x),sdy=sd(y),
            medianx=median(x),mediany=median(y),
            r=cor(x,y)) %>% ungroup()


```
---
class: top, left

### Why visualize?

However, each dataset looks very different!!

```{r look-at-data, echo=F, fig.align="center", out.width="50%"}

ggplot(data=datasaurus_dozen,mapping=aes(x=x,
                y=y,color=dataset))+
         geom_point()+
         facet_wrap(facets=vars(dataset))


```
---
### ggplot: The workhorse 


- Plots are constructed in layers.

- Structure of the command can be summarized as follows.

```{r, echo=T, eval=F}

ggplot( data=[dataset],
         mapping=aes(x=[x-variable],y=[y=variable]) +
         geom_XXX() +
         other options

```

##  Building plots for different data types

- First question to ask yourself is how many variables are involved. 

 - **univariate analysis**: distribution of a single variable
 
 - **bivariate analysis**: relationship between two variables
 
 - **multivariate analysis**: relationship between many variables, usually focusing on two while conditioning for others.

---

## Building plots for different data types

- Second question to ask yourself is what are the variable types.

 - Numerical: 
 
      - takes numerical values for each individual,
 
      - can be further classified as **continuous** or **discrete** based on whether or not the variable can (in theory) take on an infinite number of values or only whole numbers, respectively.
 
 - Categorical: 
 
      - places individuals in one of several categories or groups.
   
      - can  be further classified as  **ordinal** based on whether or not the levels have a natural ordering.

# Data

## Data: Lending Club

.pull-left-wide[

- Thousands of loans made through the Lending Club, which is a platform that allows individuals to lend to other individuals

- Data includes loans *made*, these are not loan applications
]
.pull-right-narrow[
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/lending-club.png")
```
]

???

## Take a peek at data

```{r output.lines=18}
library(openintro)
glimpse(loans_full_schema)
```

## Selected variables

<br>

.midi[
variable        | description
----------------|-------------
`loan_amount`   |	Amount of the loan received, in US dollars
`interest_rate` |	Interest rate on the loan, in an annual percentage
`term`	        | The length of the loan, which is always set as a whole number of months
`grade`	        | Loan grade, which takes a values A through G and represents the quality of the loan and its likelihood of being repaid
`state`         |	US state where the borrower resides
`annual_income` |	Borrowerâ€™s annual income, including any second income, in US dollars

loans <- loans_full_schema %>%
  select(loan_amount, interest_rate, term, grade, 
         state, annual_income, homeownership, debt_to_income)
glimpse(loans)

## Variable types

<br>

variable        | type

## Describing shapes of numerical distributions

- shape:
    - skewness: right-skewed, left-skewed, symmetric (skew is to the side of the longer tail)
    - modality: unimodal, bimodal, multimodal, uniform
- center: mean (`mean`), median (`median`), mode (not always useful)
- spread: range (`range`), standard deviation (`sd`), inter-quartile range (`IQR`)
- unusual observations

```{r hist}
ggplot(data = loans, mapping = aes(x = loan_amount)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

## Histograms and binwidth

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[binwidth = 1000]
```{r out.width = "50%"}

.panel[.panel-name[binwidth = 5000]
```{r out.width = "50%"}
ggplot(data = loans, mapping = aes(x = loan_amount)) +
